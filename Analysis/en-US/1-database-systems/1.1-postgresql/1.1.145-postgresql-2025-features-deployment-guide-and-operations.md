# 1.1.145 PostgreSQL 2025 Features — Deployment Guide and Operations

## 1. Overview

- Scope: production-ready guidance to enable, operate, and roll back PostgreSQL 2025 features (AI-native, vector, streaming, multimodal, cloud-native).
- Audience: DBAs, platform engineers, SREs.

## 2. Readiness Checklist

- Platform: Linux kernel ≥ 5.15 / Kubernetes optional
- Extensions: pgvector ≥ 0.6; AI inference extension enabled
- Observability: Prometheus + Grafana; logs and traces collected
- Security & Compliance: RLS, auditing, encryption at rest/in-transit

## 3. Enabling Key Features

### 3.1 AI-native Functions

- Enable built-in inference UDFs
- Configure model registry/project credentials

### 3.2 Vector Indexes (HNSW/IVF)

- Choose index type per workload (ANN vs exact)
- Tune parameters: M/ef_construction/ef_search

### 3.3 Streaming Windows & CEP

- Configure time semantics; watermark and window size
- Ensure exactly-once with idempotent sinks and checkpointing

### 3.4 Multimodal Storage

- Unify embeddings with consistent normalization
- Manage storage and lifecycle for large objects

## 4. Production Rollout Strategy

- Blue/Green or Canary; start with <5% traffic and stepwise increase
- Backpressure & rate limits for AI inference traffic bursts
- Capacity model: CPU/GPU/IO; target 70–80% utilization at P95

## 5. SLOs and Alerts (Templates)

- Latency: API P95 ≤ 300ms; inference P95 ≤ 1200ms; vector search P95 ≤ 200ms
- Errors: overall error rate ≤ 0.3%; critical path 5xx ≤ 0.1%
- Availability: monthly ≥ 99.95%
- Alerts: warning when thresholds exceeded 5m; critical at 2× threshold sustained 3m

## 6. Operations Playbook

- Scaling: HPA by CPU+custom QPS; GPU pool autoscaling
- Cache: warm-up embeddings and model weights pre-cutover
- Data: online index build; schedule compaction and VACUUM windows

## 7. Security and Compliance

- RLS and least privilege; audit trails 100% coverage
- Data masking for non-prod; KMS-integrated key rotation

## 8. Rollback and Recovery (Go/No-Go)

- No-Go conditions: P99 > 1s sustained 3m; error rate > 2%; anomaly in inference outputs
- Rollback steps:
  1) Freeze canary weights to 0; switch traffic to stable version
  2) Undo deployment: `kubectl rollout undo deployment/pg-2025 -n prod`
  3) Rebuild hot caches; run health checks
  4) Verify: success rate ≥ 99.9%, API P95 ≤ 300ms
- Communication: incident room + ticket with RCA within 7 days
